Metrics for the Static Analysis component to integrate with DOMjudge / Moodle.
Currently in use in my MSc thesis.

--- USAGE ---
Only applies to C / C++. Uses clang and xgrep (in repo).

Note: all scripts should be executed from the source file folder
./dump.sh <SOURCE FILE> <XML DUMP FILE TO BE GENERATED>

A _nc_<SOURCE FILE> file will be generated. This is a copy of the original file without the comments.
In most metrics, this is the file that should be used.

Example:
./metrics/halstead/timeToImplement.sh _nc_<SOURCE FILE> <XML DUMP FILE GENERATED>
