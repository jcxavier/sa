		             XGrep: XML Grep

  XGrep provides a grep-like utility for XML files. See the man page
  for further details. A number of similar utilities are available,
  including

     xmlgrep  http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-Twig/tools/xml_grep/xml_grep
     xmlgrep  http://robur.slu.se/jensl/xmlclitools/
     xmlstar  http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/
     sgrep    http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jjaakkol/sgrep.html
     xgrep    http://software.decisionsoft.com/pathanXgrepDocumentation.html
  
  The name of this software was chosen after a careful web search for
  existing software with the same name. The other xgrep, listed above,
  was released since then. Given the apparent futility of trying to
  avoid all such conflicts, this software has not been renamed.
